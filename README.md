Duration:4 weeks

Mentor: Meela Santhosh

This project focuses on automating basic home appliances using Bluetooth communication technology. It enables users to control electrical 
devices such as lights, fans, and other household appliances using a smartphone or Bluetooth-enabled device. The system is built around a 
microcontroller (typically Arduino or similar) that receives commands via a Bluetooth module (such as HC-05). These commands are interpreted
by the microcontroller to switch relays on or off, thereby controlling the connected devices.

This demonstrates the integration of wireless communication with embedded systems, offering a convenient and low-cost solution for smart home applications. It eliminates the need for manual operation and provides flexibility through remote control. Users can create a simple Android application or use any generic Bluetooth terminal app to send commands. The system ensures safety and efficiency, especially for elderly or differently-abled individuals, by reducing the need to interact physically with switches. This project serves as a practical introduction to IoT and smart living technologies.
